##Hello there!

This is the source code for my personal website at [raindeer44.github.io](raindeer44.github.io).
At the moment, the site is only an extension of work I am doing with [Free Code Camp](freecodecamp.com).
In the future, this will be a personal website dedicated to showcasing my
own work, allowing easy ways to connect with me and a personal blog.

#####**This is a work in progress**

I am a self-taught web developer still in the process of learning. This site
will grow along with me, and will not be a finished product for some time. So
please excuse broken links, = poor loading times, missing CSS, etc. If you have
any comments, feedback, suggestions or would like to contribute, please shoot
me an email at [jmthornton4@gmail.com](mailto:jmthornton4@gmail.com).
