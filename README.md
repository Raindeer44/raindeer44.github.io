##welcome to my personal website.

At the moment, the site is only an extension of work I am doing with [Free Code Camp](freecodecamp.com). In the future, this will be a personal
website dedicated to showcasing my own work, allowing easy ways to connect with me and a personal blog.

#####**This is a work in progress**

I am a self-taught web developer still in the process of learning. This site will grow along with me, and will not be a finished
product for some time.
