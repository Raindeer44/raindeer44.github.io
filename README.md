##Hello there!

This is the source code for my personal website at [jmthornton.net](http://jmthornton.net).
This is my own personal website, showcasing work I have done, providing
easy means of contact, and may eventually host a personal blog.

#####**This is a work in progress**

I am a self-taught web developer still in the process of learning. This site
will grow along with me, and will not be a finished product for some time. So
please excuse broken links, poor loading times, missing CSS, etc. If you have
any comments, feedback, suggestions or would like to contribute, please shoot
me an email at [jmthornton4@gmail.com](mailto:jmthornton4@gmail.com).
